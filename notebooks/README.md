# Notebooks Roadmap

This directory will collect all exploratory and experiment-driven notebooks produced during the project. Suggested notebooks include:

- `eda.ipynb`: Exploratory data analysis of the INCLUDE dataset.
- `model_experiments.ipynb`: Baseline and advanced model experiments for sign recognition.
- `evaluation.ipynb`: Consolidated evaluation metrics, confusion matrices, and qualitative error analysis.

> **Tip:** Keep notebooks lightweight by delegating reusable utilities to Python modules under `src/`. This ensures experiments remain reproducible and version-controlled.
